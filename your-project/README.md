## Project Description
I chose to buid a game called "Tic Tac Toe" because I used to play at it a lot when I was youger. It is a game that I know and it made sense for me to go and choose this game.


## Rules
The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares. Two players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
The first player to get 3 of his marks in a row that can be horizontaly, verticaly or diagonaly wins the game.


## Workflow

To build the game I first created a list( called:game) which represents a 3 by 3 grid and placed zero's in it to represent the blanc spots at the start of the game. Then I decided to create a function that will establish the 3 ways of winning: verticaly,horizontaly,diagonaly. I would use number "1" to represent player 1 and "2" to represent player 2. When I run the function it will give me the name of the player who wins but also in what way he won. 

## Organization

I did not use a kanban board.
The repository is composed of the main work which is the game itself that has been built on python. I have added a gitignore file that allows to avoid any unnecessary files. Moreover, I have attached a Readme file which explains the process and the characteristics of the project.
